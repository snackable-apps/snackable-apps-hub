## Paid Advertising

### Budget-Friendly Approach

- **Indonesia**: CPM $0.50-2.00
- **Philippines**: CPM $1.00-3.00 (English-speaking)

**Strategy**: Start with $5-10/day in these markets to:

- Understand user behavior and retention
- Identify which games resonate most

**Tier 2: Higher Value Markets (Once Profitable)**

- Higher CPM but higher ad revenue potential

### Campaign Types to Test
